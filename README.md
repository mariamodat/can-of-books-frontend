## Overview
The ability for a user to securly login to an application to store their data is crucial. Think about all the times you have signed up for an app using your facebook or google account. That is done through a process called OAuth. Essientially, the app allows “someone else” (an external identity “provider”) to take care of making sure that you are who you say you are.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
we will use MongoDB to store our data as well as the Authenticator to authorize the user to login .

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
we are using react js as a frontend and the auth0 framework so far .

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
 * Use the Driver-Navigator collaboration strategy to perform all changes in the code, via pull requests from semantically-named branches. Switch off Driver often, so everyone on the team has a strong record of making contributions. 
 * completed Deploy your app to the cloud. It won't do much, but check for a proof-of-life indicator that the code is running. Your team will work with this same production deployment throughout the labs in this module. 
 * completed Incorporate Auth0 into your App component.
 * ompleted Add a Profile component that is only visible when the user is logged in. This component should display information about the user provided by Auth0, such as name, profile picture, and email address.

#  Professional Pairing Practice

* What hours will you be available to communicate? lab time 
* What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)? Slack and Remo 
* How often will you take breaks? lunch time only 
* What is your plan if you start to fall behind? we will try to finish asap if we could not , we will work for extra hours at night.


Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
* How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

|fast learning and I can use it to learn new methods or to solve any issue from Youtube| manage time ,so I can divide the work equally and not to be late |
* In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
we will try to do our best to achieve the goals 
* Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
after finishing everyday work, we will  make a review to understand what we have done and explain the methods used as well.

* What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing? first of all we will be dividing the work equally , if one of us felt that he is working more so we can divide the work once again to make sure .
* What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
we will ask him that this is not fair , so we will stop the flow and redivide the work equally .
* How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
we will use the methods that we've learnt , if one of us is not getting the way that the other is using so we will explain to each other .
